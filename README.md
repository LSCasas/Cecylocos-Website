# Cecylocos - Website

I created the "Cecy Locos" website in June 2022 while studying at CECyTEM. Cecy Locos is a website dedicated to promoting its experience in snack preparation. It provides information about its locations, contact details, and surveys to interact with its customers. I used HTML and CSS, improving my understanding of these technologies.
